# OSM Address Manager

**WARNING:** Do not use this program to blindly upload addresses to OpenStreetMap! Take caution and review each address that came from this program! This is only for assisting experienced mappers.

*This is a work in progress. A final release date has not been determined.*

## What is this?

The OSM Address Manager downloads data from OpenAddresses and presents them in an intuitive interface. It gives the option of converting filtered (or unfiltered) data to a file for JOSM. After converting the data, the user can import the file into JOSM and use the addresses as an aid to editing OpenStreetMap.

## But why?

OpenStreetMap is a community-driven street map. There are many places where addresses don't exist in the map. This can be a problem when end-users go to use navigation software such as OSMAnd, and find that their destination can not be found.

Fortunately, there's a solution, OpenAddresses.

[OpenAddresses](https://openaddresses.io/) is a service that collects address information on a weekly basis. It relies on many sources by many governments and users from around the world.
